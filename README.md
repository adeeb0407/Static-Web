Background: The purpose of this assignment is to provide you hands-on experience with HTML 
and CSS.
Task: Create a website with at least 2 pages on a topic of your choice. Use well-formed HTML5 
structure including the use of semantic elements. The design/colour scheme of the web page is 
your choice. 
Note: You may not use any images or content that we use for the exercises in our class or you 
may have used in your previous in class tasks or assignments in any course. Such a section on 
your website will be marked zero.
The following are the minimum requirements:
All the web pages:

entire page is centered within the browser. Hint: usually a width of 1100px to 1200px 
works well. (1 mark)

 CSS requirements: 
• There should be appropriate space between different elements, so set the margins and 
paddings such that different elements are at least 15 pixels away from other elements. This 
enhances the overall design and readability of the page. (2 marks)
• Adjust the CSS to use your own colour scheme/design elements as you see fit. (2 marks)
• Use borders and box shadows where appropriate in your design. (2 marks)
• The navigation and footer backgrounds should be darker in colour than the rest of the site.
(2 marks)
• Adjust the CSS to use your own font scheme (size, weight, colour, font family). (2 marks)
• Make sure all the foreground and background colours follow WCAG 2.0 AA or higher 
standards. An easy way to do this is to use the Contract Checker tool here
